# 3D-Mesh-LOD-Tool
Class project from SFU Geometric Modelling course

•	Utilized winged edge data structure and C++/OpenGL to load, save and display 3D obj mesh files

•	Implemented Loop and Butterfly subdivision schemes to apply surface smoothing and generate higher detailed models

•	Implemented quadric-based edge decimation with multiple-choice algorithm to generate lower detailed models while preserving the original structure
